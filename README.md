Use this as a boilerplate for making styleguides using SASS and Bootstrap.

* Gulp
* Bower
* Sass
* Bootstrap
* Font Awesome

## Installation

Make sure You have npm and bower installed. Then from the command line execute:

  npm install

and

  bower install

After which You should be able to run the usual:

  gulp

and

  gulp watch

## Use

Adding snippets or components is easy. Just put the HTML in the *src/tpl/* folder. Then go into *src/index.html* and insert a reference to the html file and give it a title. Just see how it's done in the components that are already there. Don't worry - it's easy.

## SASS development

All styles goes into the *src/scss* directory. You are free to use Your own folder structure. This starterkit only comes with all the bootstrap pre-defines styles - so go nuts and create Your own styles the way You want.
